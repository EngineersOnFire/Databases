[Solution](SOLVED.md)

The logistics company provides transport services to companies under a contract
signed for a period of time. A contract is identified by a reference, and may include
multiple routes (at least one). Each route is covered by a specific vehicle on a specific
date. A route is identified by the starting and ending points and its length (Km). The
logistics company owns vehicles that can cover the routes. A vehicle has a number
plate and a type. Each route is covered by at least one vehicle and at most by four
different vehicles. The cost depends on the vehicle used to cover it.
