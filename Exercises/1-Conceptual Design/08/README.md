8) We need to design a database for an amusement park that meets the following requirements: 

 The amusement park opens specific days throughout the year. The dates are known in advance. We will also know the opening and closing time, and the number of tickets already sold for each day. 
 We have a list of attractions that are identified by their names. We also have information about the maximum capacity, the type of each of attraction, and the number of employees required for its operation. The location of an attraction is given by a number that can be found on the map that is offered to the visitors. 
 The company hire machinists. We know their ID, full name, date of birth and date of contract. 
 For every opening day, we need to know which machinists will be in charge of each attraction and how many hours they will spend at each of them. A machinist cannot be assigned more than three attractions in a day. The machinists can choose the days they want to work (not necessarily all). The amusement park subcontracts the maintenance of attractions to different companies. We know the name and telephone number of all of them. Each attraction must be assigned at least one of these companies. 
 Online ticket sales include credit card (required for collection), number of tickets, date of purchase and date of entry. You only can buy tickets once for a specific day with a credit card.
