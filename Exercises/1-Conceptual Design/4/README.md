# 4) The economic crisis has led to health managers to decide to look closely at the pharmaceutical expenditure of the citizens. As consequence, a new system for managing prescriptions is required and we have to design the new database. The main requirements of the health system are the following ones.

Patients are identified by their social security number. We will also need to store the name, address and age of each patient.

Doctors are identified by their collegiate member number and we also require knowing their names and years on active service. They may be specialists, general practitioners or E.R. doctors. E.R. doctors work in a hospital that we need to know. Regarding the specialists we will register their speciality. In the case of general practitioners, we need to store the health center in which they see their patients and the surgery start time. Health centers are identified by a unique code. The address of each of them is also known. All patients have assigned a specific general practitioner.

Any doctor can write a prescription for a patient. The management system will need to have certain information contained in the prescriptions: the name of the patient who the medicine has been prescribed, the prescription bar code, the date on which the prescription was made, the prescribed dose, the doctor collegiate member number and the pharmacy where the medicine was dispensed.

Each medicine is identified by its bar code and the following information associated with it have to be stored: trade name, composition, price and the pharmaceutical company that markets it. Medicines are dispensed in pharmacies and we assume that all the pharmacies dispense all the medicines. We must register pharmacy license number, address and phone number.
