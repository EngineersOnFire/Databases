# Database Requirements Food Company
[Solution](SOLVED.md)

 * We need to know some data of the employees: name, SS number, position (cook, kitchen maid, washer-up ...),
telephone number and age.
 * The company offers different dishes, each of them has associated a code, a description (chicken roasted, paella, rabbit with mushrooms...) and its price.
 * For processing each dish we need to know the required ingredients (identified by name), and the amount of each of them required for cooking the dish.
 * We also need to know which employees are able to make each dish. All employees must be able to participate in the processing of at least one dish and at most eight dishes. 
 * We will also record some data of the customers: phone number, email, and orders that they have made, which are identified by a number. Each order will have associated the date on which it was made, the included dishes and the amount of each of them
