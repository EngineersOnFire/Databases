# 3) The Traffic Department wants to keep information of the fleet of vehicles in the country in order to make the management of traffic offenses.

We need to gather information about car brands and model car brands in the market. Each brand will provide its registered name, the models available, the codes that identified each model and the power of each of them. The traffic department assigns a unique code to each brand. 

For each new car we will have to store its brand, model, registration number and some data of the owner: identification number, full name, date of birth and address (street, number, city and postal code). Keep in mind that the Traffic Department wants to keep the information of all the owners of the car. If, at any time, the car is sold, we will have to register the data associated with the new owner without losing the information corresponding to the previous ones. We also need to store the period during which each owner was in charge of the car.

When a person commits an offense and a fine is imposed, the officer collects some data: identification number, full name, date of birth and address (street, number, city and postal code). If the offense involves a vehicle, the officer also needs to collect its registration number, brand and model of the vehicle. It should be noted that fines are imposed on people, not vehicles, therefore, an officer can fine a pedestrian or an occupant of a vehicle. The fine also includes the date, officer personal registration number, the regulation that has been violated, the place where the offence took place (road, kilometer or address) and the amount that must be paid. Only personal registration number of the officer and the unit to which he belongs is included in the fine.

Each offence is identified by a unique number and only has associated a fine.
