# 2) The borough councils in our region require to maintain updated information of housing located in them. 

Every year, all borough councils must charge a tax on all the houses in the borough.
In order to do it, they will issue a receipt for each house. The receipt must include following information: the land registry number of the house, the address (street, number and floor), square meters, the tax amount and the owner that will pay the tax (although the house ownership can be shared by several people, only one of them pay the tax). The receipt will be sent to the residence of the owner, which could not be the house whose tax must be paid. The tax can be paid either in cash or by direct debit. In the last case, the owner hasto inform the council of the account number.

We will need to store the different boroughs. They will be identified by a code. The tax amount depends on several factors. Among them are the average price per square meter that corresponds to the borough where the house is located and the square meters of the house.
